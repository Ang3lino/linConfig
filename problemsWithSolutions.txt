os: "Ubuntu 18.04.2",
info: "Installed approximately a week after released",
problem: "No response when trying to add a not signed ppa repository in terminal",
solution: "Add it by using software and update GUI from ubuntu in other software tab, then update from terminal with 
    $ sudo apt-get update --allow-unauthenticated
    The extra option was necessary for not signed packages"
